DESCRIPTION:
This project demonstrates a basic speech recognition-based device control system using an Arduino Uno, simulated in Tinkercad. The goal is to control devices like a LED (representing a light) and a DC motor (representing a fan) using voice commands. Since Tinkercad doesn't support actual speech input, the voice commands are simulated by typing specific commands into the Serial Monitor. The Arduino reads these text commands and turns devices ON or OFF accordingly. For example, typing “light on” will turn on the LED, and “fan off” will stop the motor. The LED is connected to digital pin 3 through a resistor, and the motor is connected directly to digital pin 5 and GND. This project illustrates the concept of speech-controlled home automation in a simple and interactive manner, and it can be extended to real hardware by integrating voice recognition modules or Python-based speech interfaces.
